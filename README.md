**Key Note**

  - I checked some of the available public using google, I was able to find something interesting `https://github.com/azharimm/football-standings-api`. 
  - I proceeded to read the documentation to know what is needed to make a request successful.
  - I did a sketched on paper on how the User interface would look like and I followed through.
  - I used typescript with react to help check for error on complile time.
